# Discovering-the-polarity-of-unexplained-sequences-in-time-stamped-observation-data
Based on user reviews, the polarity of how positively and negatively the given book is reviewed by everyone, is computed, using adjectives as the dictionary dataset. 

We created an online Ebook library system.
Here, registered users can:
a. purchase new books.
b. add reviews about the books already purchased and read.
c. see how poitively a book was reviewed, even if the book review was in some other website.
d. compare book reviews based on datasets.
e. view consolidated feedback.
